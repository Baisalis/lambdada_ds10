Containers are fast and boots quickly as it uses host operating system and shares the relevant libraries.
Containers do not waste or block host resources unlike virtual machines.
Containers have isolated libraries and binaries specific to the application they are running.
Containers are handled by Containerization engine.
Docker is one of the containerization platforms which can be used to create and run containers.
