Two Compliments: 
1. Easy to follow. I understand that you are creating a function to find the area of a rectangle. 
2. Very clean with one exception. 

Constructive Criticism: 
1. On line 6 you have, "def __init__ (self , l , w)". You just want to remove the white space before your commas, so it reads, "def __init__ (self, l, w)" 

Otherwise it looks great. Keep up the good work!
